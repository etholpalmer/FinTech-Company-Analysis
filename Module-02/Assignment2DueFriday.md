## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Applied Energy Group opperates in the United States Energy Sector, as a Management Consulting Company.  The Energy Sector has has many kinds of power plants all across the country.  These power plants have regulations that govern their operations.  Reporting on these regulations is a legal requirement for the operations of the power company.

Constanly managing and maintaining compliance with the regulations is an ever changing and highly demanding exercise for a typical power company.  These regulations will vary based on the means that power is generated, that is a nuclear power plant will have different parameters to watch when compared to a solar power plant.  Namely there will not be a need for regulations about nuclear waste disposal for example.  Compound this issue with humdreds of plants in many different regulatory jurisdictions.  The ability of AEG to configure hundreds of requirements for each power plant and generate the required results is what sets them apart from their competitors.

However there are many similarities between these types of power generation.  These include the amount of power produced, maximum available output etc.  This is where AEG has made their distinction in the market place.  Their VisionDSM system is able to constantly montior a wide variety of inputs and provide feedback a head of time about these critical changes that need to be made for compliance reasons.

The financial consequences of not meeting regulatory compliance are significant for all power generating companies and usually determine if they make a profit or not for any given month.  The real focus in this industry is a technique they are forced to used called Demand Side Management (DSM).  The fact is that it takes years or even decades to spinup a new power plant, so the supply side of the equation cannot quickly changed based on the market's needs.  Therefore they must practice a form of management that affects their customer's demand for power.

"Energy demand management also known as demand-side management (DSM) or demand-side response (DSR) is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial incentives and behavioral change through education."

The company's raison d'Ãªtre stems from this main factor, the need to control the consumption of power.  The area of Regularoy control is a happy bi product of this type of management.  DSM has always sought to control power demand and efficiency of power delivery from the materials used in the process (wires in power transmission) to sophisticated real-time control of distributed energy resources.  Recently their have been additional tools thrown into the mix, namely smart metering and smart grids.  These "smart" systems seek to answer the question "how much power is any one section of the grid actually consuming?"

Before the pupet masters would only measure the agregate demand for a city, as the demand increased the would just add more power from differnt power plants to ensure everyone had power.  Now with "smart" devices feedback has been placed in the loop and where to send power and how much is needed can be finely tuned and targeted.  That means a power plant is able to answer critical questions based on facts.  In the past a costly decision had to be made about the need to request power from a diesel power plant whose operations and thus power a more costly than a nuclear power plant.  The operator had to guess if that power is needed it was more of an art with the rule of thumb being always keep about 10% more power than you are actually using.  With smart devices you can answer the question because smart grids can report back if they are all at capacity.  Therefore how much more would put them all at capacity, maybe just 5% therefore you would not need to fireup that diesel plant and consume expensive power.

So the problems solved are two fold, manage the demand for power by controling demand with incentives, technology improvements and consumer education and reduce expenses by improved management of expenses by improving the regulatory requirements feedback loop.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

There are about three-thousand three-hundred (3,300) power companies operating in the United States, with about 200 of them providing power to the majority of users in the United States.  As a wholey-owned subsidery of Ameresco Inc, there's already a market of the Ameresco's customers to expand to.  AEG competes on their ability uniquely customize and track their adjustments of the incentives made to the consumers of electricity to affect the demand side, juxtaposed with their ability properly manage the ever changing regulatory requirements for different jurisdictions across the United States gives them the largest competive advantage over their competitors.  At the center of a decision to switch will undoubtably be the time taken to accomodate new or unique regulatory requirements.  Where as it would be a programming change for other companies, it's a configuration change for AEG.  Thereby significantly improving agility and reducing the time to accuracy of reporting on new metrics.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
The company is currently leveraging a rules engine to stay ahead of the pack by doing more configuration changes that full blown programing changes.  The flexibility extends to their reporting as well.  Demonstrated on the website is sample reports which can be amended by end-users on the fly to produce different reports.
